## Capital Protection
- **Catastrophic Loss Prevention**: The Daily Loss Limit acts as an automated circuit breaker for the user's account, preventing a bad day from becoming a blown account.
- **Fat Finger Protection**: Position size limits prevent accidental large orders (e.g., typing 100 lots instead of 1.0).

## Regulatory Compliance
- **Responsible Trading**: Enforcing risk limits demonstrates a commitment to responsible trading practices, which is often required by regulators or prop firms.

## Operational Control
- **Emergency Stop**: The Kill Switch allows admins to instantly pause trading for the entire platform or specific users during technical issues or market anomalies (e.g., flash crash).

## User Trust
- **Safety Net**: Users feel more confident using the platform knowing there are automated safety checks in place to protect their capital.
