## 🚀 Product Strategy

### Market Segmentation

**Problem**:
- Some traders want control (approval mode) → manual friction high
- Some traders want passive income (copy-trading) → need hands-off option
- Platform only offered approval mode → lost ~40% of addressable market

**Solution** (PR-041):
1. **Conservative Users** → Approval Mode
   - Manual review before each trade
   - Full control over signal execution
   - Reduced account risk (psychological safety)
   - Perfect for learning/risk-averse traders

2. **Passive Users** → Copy-Trading Mode
   - Auto-execute all signals (100% hands-off)
   - Risk multiplier (0.1x-2.0x) for customization
   - Position caps prevent catastrophic loss
   - Perfect for "set and forget" traders

3. **Hybrid Users** → Both Modes
   - Switch between modes
   - Test approval mode, upgrade to copy when confident
   - Natural upgrade path (£20 → £50/month)

### Competitive Positioning

**Before**: "Manual approval trading"
**After**: "Any trader. Any way. Automated trading for all"

**Messaging**:
- Conservative traders: "Full control. Every trade approved by you."
- Passive traders: "Zero effort. Signals executed automatically."
- Institutional: "Enterprise automation. Professional risk controls."
