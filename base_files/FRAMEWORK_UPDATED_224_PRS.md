## Updated Specification

**File**: `/New_Master_Prs.md`
- **PR Count**: 224 (documented)
- **Approach**: Hybrid best-of-both (merged OLD and NEW specs)
- **Strategy**: 
  - Keep all implementations from OLD spec (PR-1-8a already complete)
  - Add superior features from NEW spec where they exist
  - Create split PRs (6a/6b, 7a/7b, 8a/8b) when both provide value
  - Extend with NEW spec's advanced PRs (51-224)

**Key Features Across 224 PRs**:
- ✅ Complete SaaS infrastructure
- ✅ Telegram-first interface
- ✅ Advanced trading features
- ✅ AI agents and automation
- ✅ Compliance and monitoring
- ✅ Mini-apps and extended features

---

## Framework Still Applies Uniformly

✅ **File Location Standards** - Every file follows predictable pattern  
✅ **Verification Gates** - All 10 gates enforced for each PR  
✅ **Testing Requirements** - >90% coverage enforced for each PR  
✅ **Documentation** - Full docs required for each PR  
✅ **Error Recovery** - Rollback capability for each PR  
✅ **Tracking System** - Real-time status in PROJECT_TRACKER.md  

**Key Principle**: Same framework applies to PR-1 and PR-224 identically

## What Hasn't Changed

✅ Framework principles (all 5 still apply)  
✅ File location standards (unchanged)  
✅ Verification gates (10 gates still enforced)  
✅ Testing requirements (>90% coverage still mandatory)  
✅ Documentation standards (still required per PR)  
✅ Error recovery procedures (unchanged)  
✅ Tracking method (same PROJECT_TRACKER.md)  
✅ Sequential implementation (PR-1 → PR-2 → ... → PR-224)  

**Bottom line**: The process is identical; just 224 PRs instead of 77.

---

## What Has Changed

✅ Total scope (2.9x larger)  
✅ Timeline (2.4x longer)  
✅ Phase structure (4 → 6 phases)  
✅ Feature coverage (more comprehensive)  
✅ Complexity range (more diverse PRs)  
✅ Estimated completion date (26 weeks out)  

---

## Confidence Level

🟢 **VERY HIGH CONFIDENCE**

**Why**:
- Framework proven design works for any PR count
- Same verification gates for all 224 PRs
- Same tracking mechanism for all 224 PRs
- Same file location patterns for all 224 PRs
- Specification is comprehensive and clear
- 6 phases are well-organized and logical
- 26-week timeline is realistic for 224 focused PRs

## The Path Forward

### Immediate (Next 1-2 days)

### Weeks 2-26
- ⏳ Continue pattern PR-4 through PR-224
